# stock-analysis

Overview of Project:

The purpose of this project was to assist Steve in analyzing the performance of clean energy stocks during the years of 2017 and 2018. Using VBA, we were able to analyze twelve different clean energy stocks to for Steve to advise his clients what they should be including in their portfolio to diversify it, and why.


Summary:

Refactoring the initial set of code can aid in proofreading the code to make it more user-friendly, while removing unnecessary lines that can be made more concise. This will in turn allow the script to be ran faster and with less bugs along the way. The advantages to the original VBA script would be that its easier for the coder to write the statements and for loops. Whereas the refactored VBA script required additional statements and variables.
